/*************************************************************************************************
    PURPOSE:
    This script analyzes sales performance across multiple time frames:
    
    1. Daily sales performance vs overall average
    2. Monthly sales & quantity performance with previous month comparison
    3. Year-over-year (YoY) performance of each product, analyzed using:
       - Average vs actual
       - Previous year comparison

    DATA SOURCES:
    - gold.fact_sales
    - gold.dim_products
